# BBC VR Barriers Project

Welcome to the online home of the BBC VR Barriers Project.

The project started it in late 2017 to develop an understanding of barriers within VR experiences so we can support future BBC projects and develop best practices

The goals of the project are:

1. To build a dataset of observed barriers faced by a wide range of users within VR environments. 

2. To consider if the current inclusive design principles encompass all observed barriers

3. To develop a methodology and environment for user testing VR with a diverse user group.
