## Welcome

Welcome to the online home of the BBC VR Barriers Project. The project ran from early 2018 to late 2020 to develop an understanding of barriers within VR experiences so we can support future BBC projects and develop best practices

The goals of the project are:

1. To build a dataset of observed barriers faced by a wide range of users within VR environments. 

2. To consider if the current inclusive design principles encompass all observed barriers

3. To develop a methodology and environment for user testing VR with a diverse user group.

## Barriers Dataset

The project has produced a number of documents and dataset. The main dataset is the **barriers dataset**. This download provides a summery of the 1000+ observations collected during the project, plus a user guide.

## Experiments

The purpose of the barriers research is to collect a dataset of the _large_ and _small_ barriers present within VR environments.

While solutions are not in scope for the project as a whole, itâ€™s often necessary to resolve some of the large barriers in order for the smaller barriers to be observed.

The following sections document our activity in a number of key areas.

### Performance 

A key consideration of the project has been to safeguard the well being of the participants. Participants are aged from 14 to 93. Many are vulnerable and within high risk groups for epileptic conditions.
