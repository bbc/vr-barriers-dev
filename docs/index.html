<h1>BBC VR Barriers Project</h1>
<p>Welcome to the online home of the BBC VR Barriers Project.</p>
<p>The project started it in late 2017 to develop an understanding of barriers within VR experiences so we can support future BBC projects and develop best practices</p>
<p>The goals of the project are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>To build a dataset of observed barriers faced by a wide range of users within VR environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To consider if the current inclusive design principles encompass all observed barriers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop a methodology and environment for user testing VR with a diverse user group.</p>
</li>
</ol>
